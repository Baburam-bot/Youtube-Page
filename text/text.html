        Dear Baburam,

Thank you so much for donating ₹ 29.00 to support Wikipedia and a world where knowledge is free for everyone.

Every single donation helps us to improve people’s access to accurate and reliable information, especially in a rapidly changing world. I’m truly grateful for your support in enabling billions of people to experience the gift of knowledge through Wikipedia.

We are determined to extend this access as far as possible to make sure that no matter where you are born or where you live, the ability to access free knowledge is always within your reach. I hope you will continue to support us in building a future where Wikipedia exists everywhere, with people across the world contributing to the sum of all knowledge.

Thank you again for supporting this remarkable mission, it is a privilege for me to be part of the largest collaborative project in human history. Wikipedia will always belong to you.

With gratitude,
Maryana
